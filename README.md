# Python sets

Lot of Code snippets to explain the sets in Python

Built-in Functions with Set

Function Description

*all() *Returns True if all elements of the set are true (or if the set is empty).

*any() *Returns True if any element of the set is true. If the set is empty, returns False.

*enumerate() * Returns an enumerate object. It contains the index and value for all the items of the set as a pair.

len() Returns the length (the number of items) in the set.

max() Returns the largest item in the set.

min() Returns the smallest item in the set.

sorted() Returns a new sorted list from elements in the set(does not sort the set itself).

sum() Returns the sum of all elements in the set.

Other Python Set Methods

##There are many set methods, some of which we have already used above. Here is a list of all the methods that are available with the set objects:

Method Description

add() Adds an element to the set

clear() Removes all elements from the set

copy() Returns a copy of the set

difference() Returns the difference of two or more sets as a new set

difference_update() Removes all elements of another set from this set

discard() Removes an element from the set if it is a member. (Do nothing if the element is not in set)

intersection() Returns the intersection of two sets as a new set

intersection_update() Updates the set with the intersection of itself and another

isdisjoint() Returns True if two sets have a null intersection

issubset() Returns True if another set contains this set

issuperset() Returns True if this set contains another set

pop() Removes and returns an arbitrary set element. Raises KeyError if the set is empty

remove() Removes an element from the set. If the element is not a member, raises a KeyError

symmetric_difference() Returns the symmetric difference of two sets as a new set

symmetric_difference_update() Updates a set with the symmetric difference of itself and another

union() Returns the union of sets in a new set

update() Updates the set with the union of itself and others
